Jack - make board have less clumps <= Joe said maybe not to do this. But idk if I agree
Jack - make board have no water on edge <= Joe also said maybe not to do this, but idk if I agree

Jack - sound ping on your turn
Jack - have buildings on board be labeled somehow to tell what they are --> I'll take lead on this, already started messing around with SVG text displays

Tom - get data. on game end, throw some logs of which buildings were built, who won, etc, into a local logs file that we can parse/use later.
Tom - color/display tiles and buildings to make it more clear what is fiendly and what is enemy
Tom - more/better errorHandler messages

<<<<-------------------------RESOLVED---------------------------->>>>

Jack - Bug: If you select less tiles than required, building still gets build. Example is select 2 of the 3 hexes for City Hall and it totally lets you build a 2 shape building. Related to that is the entire "invalidBuilding" errorHandler method does not function as expected. -- resolved

buildings finished:

refinery --> unique, have server give player extra resources
foundry --> unique, have server repeat turn
casino --> check for user input on what to steal and if legit, then steal on server side
tenement --> working and deductions working
lock --> ugly adjacency test on client. Check two away, and if a one away is water, and the two away is adjacent to that water, count it
lighthouse --> somewhat ugly adjacenty test on client. if two away count it
watchtower --> hex click and building click validation for if-adjacent-to-enemy-watchtower dont allow 	

bazaar --> working. turns yellow on 6 still, but is discounted by 
embassy --> check number of adajcent buildings in score counting
docks --> check number of adjacent water in score counting
ferry --> client check for extra hex that is adjacenet to water adajacent to the building
prison
monument
tunnel

Buildings done! Client logic mostly in calls from index.js into BuildingValidator, and then server interactions handled in moveProcessor
