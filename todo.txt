Jack - make board have less clumps <= Joe said maybe not to do this. But idk if I agree
Jack - make board have no water on edge <= Joe also said maybe not to do this, but idk if I agree

Jack - sound ping on your turn
Jack - have buildings on board be labeled somehow to tell what they are --> I'll take lead on this, already started messing around with SVG text displays


tunnel, prison, ferry, monument, tramway --> all can be handled by asking for an extra hex click (2 clicks for tramway), with validation. I think this happening before submit button click would be easier to code but be less intuitive

Jack - Bug: If you select less tiles than required, building still gets build. Example is select 2 of the 3 hexes for City Hall and it totally lets you build a 2 shape building. Related to that is the entire "invalidBuilding" errorHandler method does not function as expected. -- resolved

buildings finished:

refinery --> unique, have server give player extra resources
plaza --> unique, have server repeat turn
casino --> check for user input on what to steal and if legit, then steal on server side
tenement --> working and deductions working
lock --> ugly adjacency test on client. Check two away, and if a one away is water, and the two away is adjacent to that water, count it
lighthouse --> somewhat ugly adjacenty test on client. if two away count it
watchtower --> hex click and building click validation for if-adjacent-to-enemy-watchtower dont allow 	

bazaar --> working. turns yellow on 6 still, but is discounted by
