Tom - Closeable alert
Tom - highlight last opponents move
Tom - on hover show the png card of the buildings

unassigned - make above-board displays not shit

Jack - make board have less clumps <= Joe said maybe not to do this. But idk if I agree
Jack - make board have no water on edge <= Joe also said maybe not to do this, but idk if I agree
Jack - sound ping on your turn
Jack - have buildings on board be labeled somehow to tell what they are --> I'll take lead on this, already started messing around with SVG text displays

Jack - get other buildings with follow-up interface working
--> I'll start working on this as well. Some thoughts on how to break up the process:

Planning on starting work on these in the following order...

tunnel, prison, ferry, monument, tramway --> all can be handled by asking for an extra hex click (2 clicks for tramway), with validation. I think this happening before submit button click would be easier to code but be less intuitive

lock, lighthouse, watchtower --> marker placement & building effects. I'm thinking in index.js we create a function called canPlaceMarker(tile) or something and check for these specific effects as well as the usual stuff. so check if the tile is empty, non-water, has no building, is adjacent to player or adjacent via lighthouse/lock, and is not blocked by watchtower. then do a similar check for watchtowers during building tile placement

plaza --> unique, have server repeat turn
refinery --> unique, have server give player extra resources
casino --> similar tunnel/tramway/etc., but require extra click on enemy resource text rather than hex

tenement, bazaar --> build in checks in cost validation

Jack - Bug: If you select less tiles than required, building still gets build. Example is select 2 of the 3 hexes for City Hall and it totally lets you build a 2 shape building. Related to that is the entire "invalidBuilding" errorHandler method does not function as expected. -- resolved
